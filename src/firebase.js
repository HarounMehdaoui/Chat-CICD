// Firebase configuration removed for local-only usage.
// This file now exports placeholders so components importing
// `auth` or `db` won't fail when running locally without Firebase.

// Note: If you prefer to fully remove Firebase, you can delete
// this file and remove any imports of it across the codebase.
